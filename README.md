# Angular Custom Form Controls for DRY Reactive Forms

This project demonstrates how to achieve DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) principles in Angular Reactive Forms by creating Custom Form Controls, significantly reducing the boilerplate code typically required.

1. Features
* Example without custom form control (standard reactive form with boilerplate).
* Example with a reusable custom form control component.
* Example with dynamic form rendering using an array of field definitions.
* DRY code patterns to maintain clean, readable, and reusable form logic.

2. Examples Overview
* Without Custom Form ControlDemonstrates a typical reactive form.Shows the repetitive setup for FormControl, binding, validation, etc.
* With Custom Form ControlEncapsulates form control logic into a reusable component.Reduces redundancy and promotes reusability.
*  Dynamic Form RenderingAccepts an array of field configurations to render the form dynamically.Greatly reduces form setup code in components.
